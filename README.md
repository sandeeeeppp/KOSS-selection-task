Overview

This repository contains a presentation on Memory Management, comparing Manual Memory Management, Garbage Collection (GC), and Rust's Ownership Model. It explores their mechanisms, advantages, disadvantages, and real-world use cases, with a focus on ensuring memory safety and performance optimization.
Contents

    Memory Management Techniques:

        Manual Memory Management: Full control but error-prone.

        Garbage Collection: Automated cleanup with runtime overhead.

        Rust Ownership Model: Safe and performant with compile-time checks.

    Detailed Topics:

        Advanced GC Strategies (G1, ZGC, Shenandoah, Immix).

        Rust's Ownership Model (Ownership, Borrowing, Lifetimes).

        Virtual Memory System (Page Tables, TLB, Demand Paging).

        Memory Allocation Algorithms (First-Fit, Best-Fit, Worst-Fit).

        Fragmentation (Internal vs External).

    Performance Optimization:

        Cache Locality Principles (Spatial & Temporal Locality).

        False Sharing Prevention (Padding in structs).

    Debugging Tools:

        Valgrind (C/C++), Rust's Borrow Checker, GC Log Analyzers (Java).
